1. Installed the dependencies to run the service
2. cd api
3. Got issue while Starting the  service itself which are mentioned below with solution i did:
    A. running "node adonis migration:run"
        Error: ER_NOT_SUPPORTED_AUTH_MODE: Client does not support authentication protocol requested by server; consider upgrading MySQL client

        Solution
        on Terminal
        sudo mysql
        ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'HoldOn#6!';
        FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
        quit

    B. After 3 got this issue
        Error: ER_BAD_DB_ERROR: Unknown database 'adonis'

        Solution
        mysql -u root -p
        HoldOn#6!
        CREATE DATABASE adonis;
        quit

    C. The read me file does not contains command to start the node service

        Solution
        npm start

4. Automating "/api/v1/register"

    Issue 1 : While putting string value in "company_account_status:" as mentioned in docs we are getting error that it is an int type
    Solution : enter Int value in "company_account_status"

5. Automating "/api/v1/login"

   NO issue found in api with relates to API doc

6. Automating "/api/v1/users/create"

    Issue 1 : In doc it is mentioned that the route is "/api/v1/users/create" when we use this we are getting 404 not found that means this endpoint does not exist
    Solution: Check Route.js and there we can see correct route is "employees/create"

    Issue 2 : After solving issue 1 we are getting 401 unauthorized while hitting request
    Solution: In the doc it is not mentioned that this route needs a authorization. Used the token with bearer which we got after login and was able to fix this issue

    Issue 3: Getting 500 internal server error after using fresh bearer token
        {
            "status": "error",
            "data": {},
            "message": "Not logged in!"
        }

    Solution : According to docs the request body contains email and password but I Debugged the code/employeeControllers and found there is some more field which needs to be sent to create employee
        {
            "profile": {
                "role": "admin",
                "id": 10,
                "employee_email": "sarvesh.singh6@thinxnet.com",
                "employee_name": "Sarvesh",
                "password": "Yellow*99"
            }
        }
        Note : While creating employee the employee_email has to be unique so you do not get the Duplicate user_email issue
        Now we are able to create employee with this correct request body, So i will show this error in automation first and then will create employee with correct request body


7. We can verify our employee creation got success with GET employees API

8. Automating "/api/v1/users/create"
